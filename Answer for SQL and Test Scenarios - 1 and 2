1. Select e.EmpName, Top 1 salary from 
( Select Distinct Top n salary from employee e Inner Join
  Salary s on e.EmpID = s.EmpID 
  order by Salary desc
) Order by Salary 

2. Update Salary
   Set Salary = Salary + 5000
   from Employee e Inner Join Salary s
   on e.EmpID = s.EmpID 
   WHERE DATEDIFF(YEAR, DOB, GETDATE())>30
      
	  

Assumptions

There are many promo codes in the system, but we’re testing for NEW30.
User’s data is being persisted in the database and there is an api that tells if the user is an existing user or a new one.


Scenarios

1. Check the length of the promo code entered by the user, if length > 7, a client side validation saying “Promo code must not be more than 7 characters” should be displayed.
2. Case sensitivity of the applied promo code should not matter i.e.
   New30, new30, NEW30, nEw30 and so on.. should be allowed.
3. Check if the user trying to apply the promo code is a new user -
 1. If it is an existing user then the system should throw an appropriate validation message.
 2. If it is a new user
    1. System should throw a validation if amount < 1000. Check for 999 and 999.99
    2. If amount > 1000, system should apply the discount on the principal value.
      1. Check the discount applied, should not be more than 300. Check with amount 1000, 5000, 10000.
      2. Check that the discount is applied on the amount and not on the GST.
4. Try applying the code again for the same user as in pt. #3, the system should not let the user apply that promo code since it is now an existing user.
